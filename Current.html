<b>Background</b> 
<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Ross Rizal is a descendant of national hero Jose Rizal’s younger 
        half-brother Patricio Rizal, who was also a patriot and a revolutionary. Ross Rizal is a 
        prominent political figure in Calamba City, Laguna, the birthplace of his illustrious 
        ancestor. His election as mayor in 2022 marked a significant shift in the city’s 
        political landscape, ending the Chipeco family’s long-standing influence that spanned 
        over four decades. <br> <br>

<b>Election</b> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Rizal was a candidate of Partido Demokratiko Pilipino Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), the ruling 
    party of President Rodrigo Duterte, in the 2022 Philippine elections. He won the mayoral 
    position by receiving 116,777 votes, surpassing incumbent Joey Chipeco (Nacionalista Party) 
    who received 78,325 votes. This victory was seen as a turning point in Calamba City’s 
    political dynamics, as it signaled the end of the Chipeco dynasty and the rise of a new 
    leader with a fresh vision. <br> <br>
    
<b>Previous Role</b> 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Before his tenure as mayor, Rizal served as vice mayor under Chipeco from 2019 to 2022. 
        This role provided him with valuable experience and insights into city governance and 
        administration. He also learned the challenges and opportunities that the city faced, as 
        well as the needs and aspirations of its people. He used this knowledge to craft his 
        platform and agenda for his mayoral campaign. <br> <br> 
        
<b>Current Role and Accomplishments</b> 
<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        As the mayor of Calamba City, Rizal’s responsibilities are vast and varied. He oversees 
        all programs, projects, services, and activities of the city government. He is tasked 
        with enforcing laws and ordinances, generating resources and revenues, and ensuring the 
        delivery of basic services and facilities to more than 500,000 residents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Under his leadership, several initiatives have been launched to improve the lives of 
        Calamba City’s residents. During his first State of the City Address (SOCA) in July 2023, 
        Mayor Rizal cited the efforts of the city government which he said changed the face of 
        leadership, administration, and public service. He highlighted some of his achievements in 
        his first year in office, such as: <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        - Improving the city’s health care system by 
        increasing the number of hospital beds, medical equipment, and personnel; providing free 
        medicines and consultations to indigent patients; and establishing isolation facilities 
        for COVID-19 cases.<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        - Enhancing the city’s education system by providing laptops and 
        tablets to public school students and teachers; constructing new classrooms and buildings; 
        and implementing scholarship programs for deserving students.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        - Developing the city’s infrastructure by constructing new roads, bridges, drainage 
        systems, and flood control projects; upgrading the water supply system; and installing 
        street lights and CCTV cameras.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        - Promoting the city’s tourism industry by renovating historical sites and landmarks; 
        creating new attractions and events; and implementing health and safety protocols for 
        visitors.<br> - Supporting the city’s local economy by providing financial assistance 
        and livelihood opportunities to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs); 
        facilitating business permits and licenses; and creating a one-stop shop for investors.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One notable initiative under his administration was his support for local farmers. The 
      local government provided agricultural inputs for corn, fruits, and high-value crops 
      farmers. This included 2,150 sacks of fertilizer distributed across 40 barangays. This 
      initiative reflects his commitment to supporting local agriculture and ensuring food 
      security in the city.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On Jose Rizal’s 162nd birthday on June 19, 2023, Mayor Rizal expressed his pride 
      in his constituents’ appreciation for Jose Rizal’s exceptional 
      life. He led the commemoration ceremonies at the Rizal Shrine, where he unveiled a new 
      statue of Jose Rizal holding a book and a pen. He also announced that he would allocate 
      funds for the restoration and preservation of other historical sites related to Jose Rizal 
      in Calamba City. This shows his dedication to preserving and promoting the city’s rich 
      history and culture. <br><br>
<b>Future Plans</b> 
<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Mayor Rizal has expressed his commitment to continue working towards improving Calamba 
      City’s infrastructure, education system, healthcare facilities, and public services. He 
      has also emphasized the importance of transparency in governance and has pledged to uphold 
      this principle throughout his term. He said that he would regularly consult with the 
      people and listen to their feedback and suggestions. He also vowed to fight corruption and 
      hold accountable those who abuse their power or misuse public funds. He said that he would 
      work closely with the national government, the private sector, and the civil society to 
      achieve his vision of making Calamba City a progressive, livable, and sustainable city. <br> <br>
